name: "Test Build"

# This workflow builds G Hauler desktop installers for Windows 
# and uploads them as downloadable artifacts. This allows team members and 
# contributors to test pre-release builds without needing to compile locally.
#
# The workflow runs:
# - On pull requests to any branch
# - On every push to the main or develop branches  
# - On manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI (workflow_dispatch)
#
# Build outputs:
# - Windows NSIS installer (.exe) - ready-to-distribute installer package
# - Windows raw executable (.exe) - standalone executable without installer
# - macOS builds: Build steps included but commented out for future use
#
# All build artifacts are retained for 90 days and can be downloaded from the 
# Actions run summary page. This enables testing of pre-release versions
# across different environments before official releases.
